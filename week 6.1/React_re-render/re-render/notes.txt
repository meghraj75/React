 Parent Component:
The App component is the parent because:
It holds the state (title) using useState.
It manages and updates the state via the updateTitle function.
It passes the title as a prop to the Header child component

Child Component:
The Header component is the child because:
It receives data from the parent component (App) via props (title).
It is responsible for displaying the title value

__Re-render__ 

- react did some work to calculate what all should update in this component.
- the componenet actually got called (u can put a log to confirm this )
- the inspector show u bounding box around the component

re-render It happend when
- a state variable that is being used inside a component changes component re -render.
-  parent component re-render triggers all children re-redarin
